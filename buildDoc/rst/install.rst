Installing Music21
======================================

Music21 can be installed with a number of different methods. Based on your platform, choose the installation method you are most comfortable with using.







Check Your Python
-----------------------

Music21 requires Python 2.6 to run. Python 3.x is not yet supported. Check that you have Python on your system, and that that Python is up to date. Whereas many operating systems come with Python, Windows does not. Windows users will need to download install Python. 


Downloading Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 2.6 is available for all platforms and can be downloaded from the following URL:

http://www.python.org/download

Even if you have Python on your operating system, you may need to install a newer version. Multiple version of Python can exist on a system without any problems. 


Linux/Mac OS X: Finding Python Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine the Python version you have installed, open a shell or terminal (e.g. xterm, Terminal.app) and enter the following comand-line argument ::

    $ python -V
    Python 2.6.2


Windows: Finding the Python Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is not shipped with Winodws. If you have already installed Python on your computer, launch Python from the start menu or IDLE.py. View the python header to determine the installed version.






Downloading a music21 Package
------------------------------

Download the most-recent music21 paackage from the following URL. Windows users should download the .exe file; Linux / Mac OS X users should download the .tar.gz file. 

http://code.google.com/p/music21/downloads/list

For developers and advanced users, anonymous SVN access is available from Google Code. Enter the following command line argument or SVN commnds::

    svn checkout http://music21.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ music21-read-only





Installing Music21
------------------------------

After downloading the music21 toolkit, the package is installed like any other Python extension library. Python stores extension libraries in a directory called 'site-packages'. The site-packages directory is located in different places depending on your platform.

After successful installation, proceed to : :ref:`quickStart` to begin using music21.


Linux/Mac OS X Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, uncompress the .tar.gz file. 

Open a shell or terminal (e.g. xterm, Terminal.app), enter the outer-most music21 directory (using `cd`), and use `python` to execute the setup.py file with the 'install' argument: ::

    $ cd /path/to/dir/music21-version
    $ python setup.py install

On Mac OS X, and possibly on other systems, you may need special permission to write in the Python site-packages directory. An easy way to tepmorarily gain this permission is to use the `sudo` command. If the above returns a permissions error, try the following: ::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

If you cannot gain permission to install music21 in the Python site-pacakges directory, you can still run and use music21. Place the music21 folder anywhere convenient and note the file path. Start Python, and add this file path to Python's list of directories searched for modules:

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.append('/Users/ariza/Desktop/music21')
    >>>

This can be done permanently by adding the music21 directory to the Python PYTHONPATH environment variable. This is not necessary if music21 is installed in the Python site-packages directory. See the following link for more details:

http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH

After successful installation, proceed to :ref:`quickStart` to begin using music21.



Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows installation is easy. After downloading the music21.exe installer, follow and accept the prompts for default install options. This installer simply copies files into the Python site-packages directory. If the installer quits without further notice the installation has been successful. 

After successful installation, proceed to :ref:`quickStart` to begin using music21.
