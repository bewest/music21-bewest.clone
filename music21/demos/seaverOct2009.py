Indeed, you've organized the questions in order from what I believe
will be the easiest to answer to what I believe will be the hardest.
The program doesn't have a good "Label Harmony" function (just because
of how complicated and ambiguous that can be) so anything involving a
single labeled chord can be difficult.  The first and second should be
extremely easy.  The third and fifth should be easy to construct in
such a way that it doesn't miss anything but it might give some
results that are "false positives".  #4 will be the hardest to
construct, since a half cadence is something that's not determined so
much by the cadence chord and the chords directly preceding but more
from a larger sense of tonal listening which is of course harder to
teach a computer to have.

warmly,
Myke Cuthbert
