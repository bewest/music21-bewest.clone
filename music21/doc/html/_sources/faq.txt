What is the native music21 data format?

    Quick answer: there is none.

    Longer answer: music21 is a toolkit for the manipulation and analysis of data that you already have or are generating on the fly. As such, its strength is its (and python's) ability to work with many common formats and easy extensibility to work with many more. You will find that for the most part you will not need to preserve your music21 data in an interchangeable format. And the number of things you can do with music21 makes it impossible for us to create formats for every possible use. We work with music21 all the time for our work and have never needed one.
    
    But if you must store your music21 data somehow, here are some suggestions:
    
    * For data that can quickly and exactly be recreated, use the script that generates as your data storage.  Then just rerun the script to get your data back.

    * For storing music notation, musicXML output will work well for many purposes. If you just want to store an audio file or graphic of your output, MIDI or Lilypond->PNG could work.

    * For data that cannot easily be recreated (because it's computationally expensive to create, or relies on user input, or is stochastically generated), Python's pickle or cPickle packages will allow you to store your data on disk.  These files cannot necessarily be read in by a later version of music21 (This is the reverse of the problem Finale has, where you can only read older versions of files), so it should not be used for long term storage and sharing.

    * For data that cannot easily be recreated but needs long-term storage and sharing, try saving the relevant parts of the data in an XML, json, or even CSV(!) format. See plistlib http://docs.python.org/dev/library/plistlib.html or http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440595. You cannot store every element of python's object structure, but you should easily be able to store the parts that are difficult to recreate.

    * If you're programming data structures too complex to be encapsulated in one of the solutions above, you should have enough experience to create a data storage format of your own. Please consider contributing your solution to improve the package.

Can I synthesize sounds with music21?

    Maybe, maybe not.  But if that's your main goal, you're missing the point of the package. Music21 is for manipulating symbolic musical data. Symbolic output can, however, be used as control data within a large variety of synthesis packages.  And we do output MIDI, if that's good enough for your purposes.
