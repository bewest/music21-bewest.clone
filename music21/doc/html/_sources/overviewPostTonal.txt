Overview: Post-Tonal Tools
=============================================

The music21 toolkit features many tools for analyzing and creating music within a post-tonal context.

For complete documentation on post-tonal tools, see the many methods in :class:`~music21.chord.Chord` as well as the objects in :ref:`moduleSerial` such as :class:`~music21.serial.TwelveToneMatrix`, :class:`~music21.serial.TwelveToneRow`, and the many twelve tone rows defined in :attr:`~music21.serial.vienneseRows`.


Pitches as Pitch Classes
--------------------------

Any music21 :class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch`, or a  :class:`~music21.note.Note` containing Pitch, can be expressed as pitch class integer using the :attr:`~music21.pitch.Pitch.pithClass` and :attr:`~music21.pitch.Pitch.pithClassString` properties. 

In the following example, the :func:`~music21.corpus.parseWork` function is used to create a :class:`~music21.stream.Score` object. The :attr:`~music21.stream.Stream.id` attribute of each contained :class:`~music21.stream.Part` is presented in a list. 

>>> from music21 import corpus
>>> aScore = corpus.parseWork('beethoven/opus59no2', 3)
>>> [e.id for e in aScore]
[u'Violin I.', u'Violin II.', u'Viola.', u'Violoncello.']




Chords as Forte Set Classes
----------------------------

Any music21 Chord can be interpreted as a Force Set class. 



Interval Vectors
----------------------------

All music21 Chords can provide access to the associated interval vectors.



Twelve-Tone Matrices and Processing
-------------------------------------

Any music21 Chord can be interpreted as a Force Set class.
