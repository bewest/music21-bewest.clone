Overview: Streams, Scores, Parts, and Measures
==============================================

The :class:`~music21.stream.Stream` object and its many subclasses offer the fundamental container of music21 objects. As a container like a Python list (or an array in some languages), a Stream can be used to hold objects. These objects can be ordered in more than one way, or treated as an unordered collection. Objects stored in a Stream can be spaced in time; each stored object can have an offset from the beginning of the Stream. Streams, further, can store and offset other Streams, permitting a wide variety of nested, ordered, and timed structures.

Commonly used subclasses of Streams include the :class:`~music21.stream.Score`, :class:`~music21.stream.Part`, and :class:`~music21.stream.Measure`. As should be clear, any time we want to collect and contain a group of music21 objects, we do so in a Stream. Streams can, of course, be used for less conventional organizational structures. We frequently will build and pass around temporary Streams, as doing so gives us access to wide variety of tools for extracting, processing, and manipulating objects on the Stream. 

A critical feature of music21's design is that one music21 object can be simultaneously stored (or, more accurately, referenced) in more than one Stream. For examples, we might have numerous :class:`~music21.stream.Measure` Streams contained in a :class:`~music21.stream.Part` Stream. If we extract a region of this Part (using the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getMeasureRange` method), we get a new Stream containing the specified Measures. We have not actually created new Measures or their components; the output Stream simply has references to the same objects. Changes made to Measures in this output Stream will be simultaneously made to Measures in the source Part. 

This overview will illustrate key features of music21's Stream. For complete documentation on Streams, see :ref:`moduleStream`.



Appending and Inserting Objects into Streams
---------------------------------------------

Streams provide a way to structure and position music21 objects both hierarchically (as Streams nested within Streams) and temporally (as objects and Streams placed in time).

The most common application of Streams is as a place to store Notes. For an introduction to Notes, see :ref:`overviewNotes`; for complete documentation on Notes, see :ref:`moduleNote`.

Notes, like all Muisc21Objects, have a Duration object that describes the time span they occupy. The span of a Duration can be described in many ways, but a convenient measure is quarter lengths (QLs), or the number of whole or fractional quarter note durations. Notes, when placed in a Stream, also have an offset that describes their position. These offset values are also given in QLs. 

To begin, lets create an instance of a Stream and an instance of a Note. We can set the :class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch` object to represent an E, and we can set the :class:`~music21.duration.Duration` object to represent a half-note (2 QLs).

>>> from music21 import note, stream
>>> s = stream.Stream()
>>> n1 = note.Note()
>>> n1.pitch.name = 'E4'
>>> n1.duration.type = 'half'
>>> n1.quarterLength
2.0
