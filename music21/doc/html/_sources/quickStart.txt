Quick Start: Getting Started with music21
=============================================

Here are some quick steps to get up and running quickly with music21. 





Download and Install
-----------------------




First, download and install music21. 
If you have installed other Python packages, do what you normally do 
(include using setuptools/easy_install or pip). 

Otherwise, please read the full instructions here: :ref:`install`.



Start Python
-----------------------

Like all Python functionality, music21 can be run from a Python script (a .py file) or 
interactively from the Python intepreter. 



Parse Some Music
-----------------------

Once music21 is installed, parsing some music is often the first step.

Music21 comes with a large collection of music stored as MusicXML and humdrum.




View Some Notation
-----------------------

After parsing, manipulationg, or creating music21 objects, viewing them as notation is 
a common way to share and evaluate what you have done.
